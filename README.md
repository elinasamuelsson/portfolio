## Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of bits and bobs of my own making that in time (hopefully) will be fair showing of my proficiency in various script languages.

## Projects

### Calculator in vanilla JavaScript

Basic calculator made with vanilla JavaScript. It handles calculations by saving the corresponding number to the clicked buttons in a variable, and then uses eval() to solve the problem.
The calculator is as of now unstyled aside from basic layouting.

### Birgittas Smithy Website

This is a fictitious website for an independent blacksmith business written purely in HTML and CSS (aside from the service worker and manifest). It was a school assignment meant to teach us SEO techniques. The fictitious website makes use of a service worker and a manifest for PWA functionality.

### Honkai Star Rail Character Viewer - vanilla JavaScript

A small website showcasing my character roster in the game Honkai Star Rail by fetching data from a json-file. I have added a manifest and a service worker to enable PWA functionality and caching. The page as is right now is very bare-bones both in terms of styling and functionality but will be updated as I continue work on it.

Future planned updates: The main list will be searchable, and each character clickable for more details, visual updates.

### Honkai Star Rail Character Viewer - React [COMING SOON]

As above, but made using React rather than vanilla JavaScript.

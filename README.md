# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of bits and bobs of my own making that in time (hopefully) will be fair showing of my proficiency in various script languages.


Projects

Calculator in vanilla JavaScript
Basic calculator made with vanilla JavaScript. It handles calculations by saving the corresponding number to the clicked buttons in a variable, and then uses eval() to solve the problem.
The calculator is as of now unstyled aside from basic layouting.

Honkai Star Rail Character Viewer - vanilla JavaScript [COMING SOON]
A small website showcasing my character roster in the game Honkai Star Rail by fetching data from a json-file. The list will be searchable, and each character clickable for more details.

Honkai Star Rail Character Viewer - React [COMING SOON]
As above, but made using React rather than vanilla JavaScript.

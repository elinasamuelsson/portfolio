## Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of bits and bobs of my own making that in time (hopefully) will be fair showing of my proficiency in various script languages.

## Projects

### Portfolio Website
#### https://elinasamuelsson.github.io/portfolio/

Portfolio website with my CV, skills, links, etc. coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now this is a work in progress.

### Birgittas Smithy Website
#### https://elinasamuelsson.github.io/portfolio/birgitta/index.html

This is a fictitious website for an independent blacksmith business written purely in HTML and CSS. It was a school assignment meant to teach us SEO techniques.

### Honkai Star Rail Character Viewer - vanilla JavaScript
#### https://elinasamuelsson.github.io/portfolio/hsr/index.html

A small website showcasing my character roster in the game Honkai Star Rail by fetching data from a json-file. The page as is right now is very bare-bones both in terms of styling and functionality but will be updated as I continue work on it.

### Calculator in vanilla JavaScript

Basic calculator made with vanilla JavaScript. It handles calculations by saving the corresponding number to the clicked buttons in a variable, and then uses eval() to solve the problem.
The calculator is as of now unstyled aside from basic layouting.

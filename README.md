## Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of bits and bobs of my own making that in time (hopefully) will be fair showing of my proficiency in various script languages.

## Projects

### Portfolio Website
#### https://elinasamuelsson.github.io/portfolio/

Portfolio website with my CV, skills, links, etc. coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of now this is a work in progress.

### Birgittas Smithy Website
#### https://elinasamuelsson.github.io/portfolio/birgitta/index.html

This is a fictitious website for an independent blacksmith business written purely in HTML and CSS. It was a school assignment meant to teach us SEO techniques.
